      <p>
        Thanksgivning is always as special time for me. Having spend most of the holidays away from family since college;
        thanksgiving has become a way for me to appreciate the surrounding friends I made throughour the years. I would create a menu inspired by the concept of meat and threes, mimicing the American Southern soul food traditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        When building the menu, I think distinctively about the mains and the sides, and how the two would work together.
        Here I provided you with recipes I've used and loved.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll leave it up to you to decide how to combine them. The food is the art and you're its artist.
