        I was never the biggest fan of turkey. It's too much food and I get tired of it too quickly. I have always
        elected
        to go with other kinds of meat that remains hearty and full.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bbq ribs is a go to for me. Taking over 6 hours all said and done, it serves as a good representation as the
        amount of love and care I have for my friends.
      </p>

        There have been instances which I get too lazy tho. In those cases the fried chicken is my best friend.
